# Create a React App!

In this warmup the goal is to practice making a React app from the ground up! 

You have been tasked with delivering a React app to the client using their given business logic (found in  `rotation.js`).

The wireframe from the product owner for this project is [here](https://wireframe.cc/KePV8d).

If you have any questions, feel free to ask!

A few guidelines to remember:
- You will want a linter
  - This client hates semi-colons
- You will want some tests
- The client is color blind, so any color scheme you may or may not choose will be awesome!
